Build a Python Application to Classify and Rank Dataset

The objective of this project is to build a python application that classifies the price range category to which the smartphone falls and also to rank the features of a smartphone.

The dataset has 2000 rows and 21 features of a smart phone. To proceed with this dataset for the given problem of ranking smartphone features based on user requests, I followed these steps:

Checked for missing values in the dataset and handled them appropriately.

Explored the dataset using statistical analysis and visualization to understand the distribution of the features and their relationships with each other.

Identifed the most important features using feature importance scores from machine learning models (or we could use other feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, or mutual information).

Ranked the features based on their importance scores.
